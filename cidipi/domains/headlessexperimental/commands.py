    Timestamp of this BeginFrame in Renderer TimeTicks (milliseconds of uptime). If not set,
the current time will be used.

    Whether updates should not be committed and drawn onto the display. False by default. If
true, only side effects of the BeginFrame will be run, such as layout and animations, but
any visual updates may not be visible on the display or in screenshots.

    If set, a screenshot of the frame will be captured and returned in the response. Otherwise,
no screenshot will be captured. Note that capturing a screenshot can fail, for example,
during renderer initialization. In such a case, no screenshot data will be returned.
